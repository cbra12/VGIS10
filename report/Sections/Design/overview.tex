\section{Design Overview}
Based upon current SOTA ensemble methods is common practice to improve generalisation of a system.
As shown in results of COCO, resolution of an object in an image a major factor in performance.
Another issue not often discussed in works is image quality. Can be a factor in performance - cite IQDNN paper
Different methods to tackle this problem. 
for resolution, dependent on two parts of the the object detector, 1. object proposals 2. classification of proposals
	if proposals have a low recall then classification part of detector is never presented with objects and no way to classify them
	if classification is poor then cannot classify.....
possible to create an ensemble for either, chosen to concentrate on the latter

plan
address pillars 1 and 3 of an ensemble system
1 - train on different subsets of data
previous works have done this randomly and tested on a validation set
here, instead actively create different subsets to train on and to test on
3 - ensemble detections of above models
majority, dynamic, etc

present method as to how to measure image quality
what is FR IQA / NR IQA?
