\section{Object Detection}

- important that object detector is translation-invariant
by nature image-level classification favors translation invariance. A shift of an object inside an image should be indiscriminative
However, object detection needs to localise representations that are translation-variant to an extent. Translation of an object inside a candidate box should produce meaningful responses for describing how good candidate box overlaps object
