	%%%%Overview%%%%
	- intro to older (non-CNN/deep) methods
		- find from survey
		- eg hand picked feature extractors/SVMS
		- sliding window approaches
		- DPM
	- CNN based methods - taken over since Alexnet (2012) on Imagenet
		- was this classification
		- extended to object detection (use classification network)
		- increase in complexity with CNNs, increase in time per window
			- overcome with region proposals
		- became a 2 step process
			1. find a number of region proposals where an object may be situated
			2. determine if a given proposal is a given pre-defined class
		- overview of proposal methods
			- grouping & window scoring
				- summary of both
			- should be accurate & have high repeatability (see why in dollar cite)
		- pipeline therefore:
			- with a given region proposal method apply deep-based classifier on regions
			- multiple current SOTA do this or similar
				- R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN (accurate but not real-time)
				- SSD, YOLOv2/YOLO9000, R-FCN 
					- alternatives to R-CNN 
						- often use some of the same methods (RPN)
				- best instance segmentation COCO 2016 - 2nd best bbox COCO 2016 (2016????)
