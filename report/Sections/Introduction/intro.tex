	%%%%Overview%%%%
	- fundamental problem in CV
		- much work over previous decades
	- goal: find specific category in a given image
		- of interest by itself. Localise and classification
		- also a pre-requisite step to higher-level vision tasks
			- activity & event recognition, scene understanding, + find more
	- difficulties 
		- inter-class differences small
		- intra-class variations large
			- shape, pose, colour, texture, background, differences in illumination/viewpoint etc between images
	- GPU/deep learning advances have meant that performance is starting to become satisfactory for real-world use in scenarios requiring high precision and accuracy
		- autonomous vehicles, military, medicinal
	- much discussion of AI taking labor jobs
		- find articles and specific examples
			- elon musk, bill gates, etc (leaders of tech)
		- object detection needed
		- improvements still to be made before being completely realised
	- next section, overview of object detection definition, key task and challenges within. Also SOTA related work
