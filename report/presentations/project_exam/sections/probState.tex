        Based on the SoTA super-resolution convolutional neural network, SRCNN, by Dong et al., we aim to investigate the following:\\
        ~\\


        \textit{How can a state-of-the-art CNN based SR algorithm be enhanced to create images of higher quality?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How does a SRCNN optimised to specific image types, such as faces, perform?
            \item How does a SRCNN combined with a classic SR method perform?
        \end{itemize}
