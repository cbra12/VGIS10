A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration
===============================================
Discription of the pinhole camera model used in the camera calibration algorithm

Motivations
===========
- necessary step in 3D CV in order to extract metric info from 2D images.
- camera calibration - 2 categories
	- photogrametric calibration
	- self-calibration

- 3D reference object-based calibration - performed by observing a calibration object whose geometry i 3D space is known with very good precision
	- efficient
	- can be expensive and elaborate
- self-calibration - do not use any calibration object. Move a camera in a static scene, ridgity of scene provides two constraints on cameras' internal params
	- 3 images are therefore sufficient to revoer both internal/external params

- proposed technique only requires camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least 2) different orientations
- pattern placed on planar surface and then either camera or surface moved by hand
	- motion need not be known
- uses 2D metric info and lies between the two definitions of calibration
	- PC - uses explicit 3D model
	- self-cal - uses motion rigidity or equivalently implicit 3D info

Basic Equations
===============
- camera is modeled by usual pinhole
- relationship between a 3D point M and its image projection m is given by:
	sm = A[R t]M
	- s arbitrary scale factor
	- (R, t) - extrinsic params - the rotation and translation which relates world coord system to camera coord system
	- A camera intrinsic matrix
		- (u0, v0) coords of principal points
		- alpha and beta scale factors in image u and v axes

Summary of Method
=================
1. print a pattern and attach it to a planar surface
2. take a few images of the model plance under different orientations by moving either the plane of the camera
3. detect the feature points in the images
4. estimate the five intrinsic params and all the extrinsic params using the closed-form solution
5. refine all params, including lens distortion params
